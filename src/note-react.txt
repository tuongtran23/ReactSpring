First node needs installing so 3 commands can have version:
    + npm
    + npx
    + node

create an react app:
    + npx create-react-app@4.0.3 frontend

start the app:
    + npm start


Wiring the POST endpoint with a button in the UI, his button was chosen in url "https://ant.design/components/icon":
    - In App.js
        + Add:  import { PlusOutlined } from '@ant-design/icons'
        + Change the followings in Table bracket:

            Add <Button> in "title" attribute
            In <Button> "icon" attribute, set icon attribute to <PlusOutlined/>

            Result:
            return <Table    title={()=>
                    <Button type="primary" shape="round" icon={<PlusOutlined/>} size="large">
                        Add New Student
                    </Button> }
                />;
             }

Integrate StudentCrawerForm into App.js:
    - Create StudentCraweForm.js and paste the copied content from Amigose course

    - In Apps.js do the followings:

        // 1
        import StudentDrawerForm from "./StudentDrawerForm";

        // 2
        const [showDrawer, setShowDrawer] = useState(false);

        // 3
        Add StudentDrawerForm component (parallel to table component)
        <StudentDrawerForm showDrawer={showDrawer} setShowDrawer={setShowDrawer}/>

        Change from "Return <Table />" to:

            Return <> <StudentDrawerForm/> <Table/>  </>

        // 4
        Adding onClick attibute to Button component in Table component
        onClick={() => setShowDrawer(!showDrawer)}


- Define addNewStudents in client.js:
    export const addNewStudents = (student) =>
        fetch("api/v1/students", {
            headers:{
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            },
            method: 'POST',
            body: JSON.stringify(student)
        });

- Task: Figure out how onFinish and onFinishFailed works under the hood in Form Component

- Note:

    In React, all component will have attributes and each will be set to a variable as other component
        +Ex:
         const antIcon = <LoadingOutlined style={{ fontSize: 24}} spin/>

         then <Spin indicator={antIcon} />

    Also, in component definition, if the component is defined with arguments as follows:

        function StudentDrawerForm({showDrawer, setShowDrawer, fetchStudents}) { impletmentation ...}

    It then will be called as a component in App as follows:
        <StudentDrawerForm showDrawer={some variable} setShowDrawer={some variable} fetchStudents={some variable}/>
